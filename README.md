# Neural Networks Iris Project

This repository contains code for experimenting with neural networks using the Iris dataset and toy datasets. It includes data loading, distributed training, and basic neural network utilities.

## Structure

- `iris/classifier.py` - Classifier script with dataset loading and utilities
- `data/` - Contains `train.csv` and `test.csv` for experiments
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Setup

1. **Create a Python virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the dataset script to check data loading:

```sh
python classifier.py
```

Modify and extend the code for your neural network experiments!
